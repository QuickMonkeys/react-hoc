# React - Higher Order Components

## A simple example to demonstrate how Higher Order Components can be used.

Basically a Higher Order Components (HOCs) is a react component that wraps another one.

This is a feature that provides a reusable development with react.

To get the code:

`git clone https://github.com/QuickMonkeys/react-hoc.git`

`cd react-hoc`

run `npm i` to install node_modules

run `nf start` to start the application using Foreman.

You can see a live [Demo](http://react-hoc-quick.herokuapp.com/) here.
